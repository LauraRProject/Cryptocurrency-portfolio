### Methodology
To ensure accurate and up-to-date information, we connected the dashboard to the CoinGecko API, specifically using the get coin/markets endpoint to fetch live prices and 24-hour percentage changes. Data was integrated into the spreadsheet using Power Query, which allows for efficient transformation and analysis.

This setup enables users to easily extend the tool's capabilities to other coins or tokens by simply modifying the API call.

        By analyzing real-time data and trends, the tracker helps investors decide when to sell or hold 
        their coins, ensuring that decisions are backed by the latest market insights.
